```
The currently only thing you can do in this project is running the bot that contains some "internal" modules.

To run this bot,
1- Rename existing "config.example.json" to "config.json" and configure the bot.
2- Use "dotnet ef database update" to create database
3- Build the project with "dotnet build" and you are good to go.
